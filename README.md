## Python mass-transport.

Pymt is a tool aiming to make means of mass transportation provisioning available to anyone using the underlying `API` for their `telematics` all in one dashboard.
Pymt is a Python module built to `scrape` means of mass transport telematics webpages on will, and then analyze said data and make simple predictions on usage, frequency and occupancy.

It aims to be as modular as possible and offer different modules for various mmt companies. The user can then request the specific telematics from those.

The final result is a combination of many platforms for different needs, such as `Redis`, `Influxdb`, `Grafana`, `Docker`, `Python`, `Flask` and more.

## Support

It currently only supports `OASTh`, a Thessaloniki-based bus company, which the module was initialy built for. We hope to support more in the future.

## Installation and Usage

Documentation is on the TODO list and is a also a work in progress.

_Documentation is also a WIP, and is planned to be updated soon. At this point, some of it might be inaccurate as the project takes shape and is not in its final form!_
